        "answer": "We only charge fees when we really need to. If you cancel or reschedule an appointment after 3:00 pm the day before your cleaning, we may charge a $40 last-minute change fee. If you choose to cancel your recurring service before your second visit, we will charge you $69, to bring your pricing closer to our 'one-time' service offering."
